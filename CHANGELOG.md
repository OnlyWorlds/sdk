# Changelog

All notable changes to `@onlyworlds/sdk`. Maintained from 3.1.0 onward (Kael, Assembly);
earlier history lives in git log only.

## [Unreleased — 4.0.0] (branch `v4`)

**v2-native only.** See `docs/migrating-3-to-4.md`. 3.x stays published forever for
pinned consumers.

### Removed (BREAKING)
- The v1 client (`OnlyWorldsClient`), the v1 `ElementType` enum, `icon-utils`.
  `ElementType` at the root is now THE v2 slug union (was `V2ElementType` alias in 3.x).
- CJS build — the package is ESM-only with a sealed `exports` map (`"type": "module"`,
  `sideEffects: false`).

### Changed
- Metadata tables (`ELEMENT_ICONS`, `ELEMENT_LABELS`, `ELEMENT_SECTIONS`, `FIELD_SCHEMA`,
  `getElementIcon`, `getElementLabel`) ported onto the v2 slug union — same export names,
  same shapes, contents byte-identical EXCEPT: `FIELD_SCHEMA` `type: 'number'` →
  `'integer'` (70 entries; 'number' dropped from `FieldType`). Migration: consumers
  switching on `'number'` switch on `'integer'`.
- `TokenResource` now takes a structural `TokenTransport` (`{ request<T>(method, path,
  body?) }`) instead of the removed v1 client. Token surface retained pending the
  wire-fate ruling (RFC-001 §5) — may be removed in a later 4.x.

### Added (post-alpha.0, same night)
- **`ELEMENT_ICONS` GENERATED** from keel's `icon:` wrapper key (keel `56c124a`).
- **`ELEMENT_SECTIONS` DERIVED** from the canonical schema's own document structure
  (Skeld's ruling: sections are the standard tier's property groups; document order is
  display order). Divergence check vs the old hand table found and fixed three fossils:
  creature "Behaviour"→"Behavior", pin's triple-listed generic link → `element`,
  relation "Involves" listing a nonexistent `relations` field. Canonical is truth.
- **`SCHEMA.md`** — full generated schema reference (every field with its canonical
  description, link directions, families, icons, sections), ships in the tarball;
  covered by the codegen drift guard. AGENTS.md points agents at it first.
- **`OwV2Client.request()` is public** (typed escape hatch; does not sanitize) and
  structurally satisfies `TokenTransport` — `new TokenResource(client)` just works.
  Token ruling (Skeld): keel keeps `/tokens/*` long-term; ported, not deleted.
- README rewritten v2-native (v1 sections, branded types, and the encrypted-key
  walkthrough removed; bulk partial-failure and idempotency-key hygiene promoted).

### alpha.1 — consumer-pin fixes (Temper's atlas review, same night)
- **`parseEnvelope` → `parseErrorEnvelope`** (it parses the platform *error* envelope;
  renamed before the 4.0 name freeze to avoid collision with the world-export envelope).
- The never-whitelist LAW now lives as a comment on `READ_ONLY_FIELDS` itself.
- Stale v1 example in the shipped d.ts fixed (TokenResource JSDoc).

### Planned before release (RFC-001 gates)
- Skeld's live wire-log v1-traffic query (gate 3) + the `/tokens/*`-under-v2 base-path
  answer. Alpha publishes to the `alpha` dist-tag only — never `latest`. **No `npm
  deprecate` on 3.x** (amended per landscape research — 3.x stays plainly supported;
  README framing carries the message). 4.x wishlist grows: account client (list/mint/
  create — atlas first consumer, hand-rolls it today) and a world-export envelope
  reader (§8c; atlas + future importers would drop hand-rolled copies).

## [3.1.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Canonical element colour palette** (`src/v2/palette.ts`, exported from root):
  `ELEMENT_FAMILIES` (type → family), `FAMILY_COLORS` (family → `{light, dark}` hex),
  `familyOf(type)`, `elementColor(type, mode)`, `FAMILY_ORDER`, type `ElementFamily`.
  Four semantic families (agents / world / abstract / temporal) ruled 2026-07-22 after
  CVD-validated measurement (Orrery `product/schema/element-palette-measurements.md`).
  Colour carries the FAMILY; `ELEMENT_ICONS` carries the TYPE. Keyed on the v2 slug
  union. First proven live in atlas and council, whose local copies become re-exports.
  **`ELEMENT_FAMILIES` is GENERATED** from the `family:` key in keel's schema YAML
  (keel `c69366b`, a keel presentation-wrapper key — not part of the council-governed
  OnlyWorlds standard); hexes are hand-authored design constants beside it. Membership
  and hex invariants test-gated (`test/palette.test.mjs`); light hexes render-proven on
  the ruled OnlyWorlds light mode (ow-house-light) 2026-07-23.
- **Codegen drift guard**: `python codegen/generate_types.py --check` fails if
  `types.generated.ts` doesn't match the schema YAMLs (release gate; mirrors keel's
  schema CI job). Codegen also hard-fails on missing/invalid `family:` keys — the
  canary for a canonical-refresh that overwrote keel's wrapper layer.
- **CI**: GitHub Action building + running the full suite against the compiled bundle.
- **AGENTS.md** shipped in the tarball — usage guide for AI agents reading the package
  locally, including the SDK-vs-MCP division of labor and the wire gotchas.
- README: worked create→link→read-back round-trip, schema-verified field by field
  (also fixes the old example patching `'character'` with a location's id); canonical
  colour section; SDK-vs-MCP guidance.
- This CHANGELOG.

### Fixed
- `FieldType` union now includes `'number'` — the legacy alias that 70 `FIELD_SCHEMA`
  entries actually carry (consumers switch on it; data normalization deferred to 4.0).
- `generate_types.py` exits with a clear message when the sibling keel checkout is
  absent instead of a bare traceback.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-18

- v2-native client (`OwV2Client`) absorbed from Assembly's ow-v2-client v0.9.0 (Kael),
  wire-corrected against live staging fixtures (S22). Generated element types from the
  canonical keel schema YAML (`src/v2/types.generated.ts`), validated against all 1,086
  live W11 elements. v1 surface unchanged and frozen.
