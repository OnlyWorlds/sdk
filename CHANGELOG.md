# Changelog

All notable changes to `@onlyworlds/sdk`. Maintained from 3.1.0 onward (Kael, Assembly);
earlier history lives in git log only.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Canonical element colour palette** (`src/v2/palette.ts`, exported from root):
  `ELEMENT_FAMILIES` (type → family), `FAMILY_COLORS` (family → `{light, dark}` hex),
  `familyOf(type)`, `elementColor(type, mode)`, `FAMILY_ORDER`, type `ElementFamily`.
  Four semantic families (agents / world / abstract / temporal) ruled 2026-07-22 after
  CVD-validated measurement (Orrery `product/schema/element-palette-measurements.md`).
  Colour carries the FAMILY; `ELEMENT_ICONS` carries the TYPE. Keyed on the v2 slug
  union. First proven live in atlas and council, whose local copies become re-exports.
  **`ELEMENT_FAMILIES` is GENERATED** from the `family:` key in keel's schema YAML
  (keel `c69366b`, a keel presentation-wrapper key — not part of the council-governed
  OnlyWorlds standard); hexes are hand-authored design constants beside it. Membership
  and hex invariants test-gated (`test/palette.test.mjs`); light hexes render-proven on
  the ruled OnlyWorlds light mode (ow-house-light) 2026-07-23.
- **Codegen drift guard**: `python codegen/generate_types.py --check` fails if
  `types.generated.ts` doesn't match the schema YAMLs (release gate; mirrors keel's
  schema CI job). Codegen also hard-fails on missing/invalid `family:` keys — the
  canary for a canonical-refresh that overwrote keel's wrapper layer.
- **CI**: GitHub Action building + running the full suite against the compiled bundle.
- **AGENTS.md** shipped in the tarball — usage guide for AI agents reading the package
  locally, including the SDK-vs-MCP division of labor and the wire gotchas.
- README: worked create→link→read-back round-trip, schema-verified field by field
  (also fixes the old example patching `'character'` with a location's id); canonical
  colour section; SDK-vs-MCP guidance.
- This CHANGELOG.

### Fixed
- `FieldType` union now includes `'number'` — the legacy alias that 70 `FIELD_SCHEMA`
  entries actually carry (consumers switch on it; data normalization deferred to 4.0).
- `generate_types.py` exits with a clear message when the sibling keel checkout is
  absent instead of a bare traceback.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-07-18

- v2-native client (`OwV2Client`) absorbed from Assembly's ow-v2-client v0.9.0 (Kael),
  wire-corrected against live staging fixtures (S22). Generated element types from the
  canonical keel schema YAML (`src/v2/types.generated.ts`), validated against all 1,086
  live W11 elements. v1 surface unchanged and frozen.
